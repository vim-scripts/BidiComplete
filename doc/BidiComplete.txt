DESCRIPTION					    *BidiComplete-description*

The built-in insert mode completion |i_CTRL-N| searches for words that start
with the keyword in front of the cursor. Any text after the cursor is ignored.
So when you want to replace "MyFunnyVariable" with "MySpecialVariable", you
have to delete everything after "My", then start completion, which now also
offers "MySpecialFunction", "MySpecialWhatever", in which you're not
interested in. If you only removed the "Funny" part, the list of
(inapplicable) completions would be the same, and you would finally end up
with "MySpecialVariableVariable", requiring additional edits.

This plugin offers a custom completion function that considers the text after
the cursor; if there is no keyword immediately after the cursor, it behaves
like the built-in completion. It even works when there is only text after, but
not before the cursor, so completion on "|Variable" yields
"MySpecialVariable", "MyFunnyVariable", etc. The base for completion is
derived from the string of keyword characters before and after the cursor, so
set your 'iskeyword' option accordingly.

USAGE							  *BidiComplete-usage*

In insert mode, invoke the bidirectional completion via CTRL-X CTRL-B.
You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.

							     *i_CTRL-X_CTRL-B*
CTRL-X CTRL-B		Find matches for words that start with the keyword in
			front of the cursor and end with the keyword after the
			cursor.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					   *BidiComplete-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim BidiComplete*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					   *BidiComplete-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |CompleteHelper.vim| plugin (vimscript #3914).
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.010 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					  *BidiComplete-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

			   *b:BidiComplete_complete* *g:BidiComplete_complete*
Analoguous to the 'complete' option, you can specify which buffers will be
scanned for completion candidates. Currently, '.' (current buffer), 'w'
(buffers from other windows), and 'b' (other listed buffers) are supported. >
    let g:BidiComplete_complete = '.,w,b'
The global setting can be overridden for a particular buffer
(b:BidiComplete_complete).
							  *BidiComplete-remap*
If you want to use a different mapping, map your keys to the
<Plug>(BidiComplete) mapping target _before_ sourcing the script (e.g.
in your |vimrc|): >
    imap <C-x><C-b> <Plug>(BidiComplete)
<
