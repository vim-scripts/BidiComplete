DESCRIPTION
The built-in insert mode completion i_CTRL-N searches for words that start
with the keyword in front of the cursor. Any text after the cursor is ignored.
So when you want to replace "MyFunnyVariable" with "MySpecialVariable", you
have to delete everything after "My", then start completion, which now also
offers "MySpecialFunction", "MySpecialWhatever", in which you're not
interested in. If you only removed the "Funny" part, the list of
(inapplicable) completions would be the same, and you would finally end up
with "MySpecialVariableVariable", requiring additional edits.

This plugin offers a custom completion mapping that considers the text after
the cursor; if there is no keyword immediately after the cursor, it behaves
like the built-in completion. It even works when there is only text after, but
not before the cursor, so completion on "|Variable" yields
"MySpecialVariable", "MyFunnyVariable", etc. The base for completion is
derived from the string of keyword characters before and after the cursor, so
set your 'iskeyword' option accordingly.

USAGE
In insert mode, invoke the bidirectional completion via CTRL-X CTRL-B.
You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.

CTRL-X CTRL-B           Find matches for words that start with the (optional)
                        keyword in front of the cursor and end with the
                        (mandatory) keyword (or non-keyword non-whitespace,
                        either optionally separated by whitespace) after the
                        cursor.

EXAMPLE
(the "|" denotes the cursor)

The B|Complete
    will complete to "BidiComplete"
The |Complete
    will offer all words ending with "Complete"
The d|.
    will complete to "dog" if that word ends somewhere with a period (the
    completion base after the cursor is mandatory, and non-keyword characters
    are taken, too)
My | lady
    will complete to "fair" from "fair lady". There's no leading base, as
    whitespace before the cursor is ignored, but for the mandatory trailing
    base, " lady" is taken.
